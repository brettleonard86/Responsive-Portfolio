            <p><img div class="image" src="assets/images/LilJay.jpg" height="200px" align="left">I graduated from the University of Kansas in May of 2009 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Education and an emphasis on Sport and Fitness Management as well as a minor in Business.

            As Ad Traffic Coordinator for GCSAA, I am responsible for a variety of roles within the Corporate Sales department, an $8 million property. I am responsible for managing a handful of clients and promoting the message of GCSAA through partnership with their brands. I work internally as a liaison between our sales and publications teams, updating both teams on what is available for sale and what has been sold. In turn, I am also responsible for managing the relationship with our print rep, the production of our magazine and all of the special advertising opportunities with each monthly issue. Digitally, I am responsible for implementing and tracking impressions for our partners online ads and was instrumental in creating personalized dashboards and reports in both Google Analytics and DoubleClick to determine the ROI for our advertising partners.
